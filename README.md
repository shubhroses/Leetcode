# Leetcode

Hi I have been actively using leetcode for almost 6 months now and have solved 300+ problems and getting better day by day. I wanted to share some of my findings from leetcode discussion treasure.

**Tip: Tip: Learn algorithms with black box method**

you can learn concepts of most algorithms and solve problems with them without actually knowing the internal working, but eventual learn the internal working. Refer below

By this method you can cover a lot of breadth and depth concurrently

I use this personally, this was inspired from colin galen.

All The Best !!!
